# Model-Fit-Optimization
Data Analysis Scripts: These scripts run through all possible combinations of independent variables and determine the model specification with the best model fit statistic.


These scripts are intended for data analysis applications as a quick way to test different combinations of variables for your models. 
Basically, these scripts run through all possible combinations of independent variables and estimate a statistical model for each possible combination. 
They then output the model which has the best model fit statistics.

Of course, this model is often not theoretically sound. It is up to you to ensure your models are properly vetted for theoretical plausibility, etc. 
These scripts are just a handy way of approaching a new dataset and they can help you get started in developing your theory.

Note that there is currently only a script for OLS regressions. 
I will add more statistical models soon (or you can modify the script with a few minor changes to work for other types of models).

Also Note that the sample data the Titanic dataset) is obviously not my own. It is a widely used sample dataset you can use to test the scripts.
